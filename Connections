Here’s a basic guide to using a breadboard for your catapult project:

Place Your Servo: Insert the three wires from your servo motor into three separate rows on the breadboard.
Connect to Arduino:
Use a jumper wire to connect the servo’s red wire (power) to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
Use another jumper wire to connect the servo’s black or brown wire (ground) to a GND pin on the Arduino.
Use a third jumper wire to connect the servo’s signal wire (usually yellow, orange, or white) to a digital pin on the Arduino (like pin 9).
Add a Button (if you’re using one):
Place the button on the breadboard so that it straddles the center divide.
Connect one side of the button to another digital pin on the Arduino (like pin 2) with a jumper wire.
Connect the other side of the button to a GND pin on the Arduino with another jumper wire.
Power Rails:
Some breadboards have red and blue lines along the sides—these are power rails for common power connections.
Connect a jumper wire from the red power rail to the 5V pin on your Arduino and another from the blue power rail to a GND pin.
